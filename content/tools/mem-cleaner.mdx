Mem Cleaner is a simple and efficient command-line tool written in Rust for detecting and managing duplicate files in a directory. It scans the specified directory (including subdirectories) and identifies duplicate files based on their names and sizes.

## Features
- Scans the current or specified directory and subdirectories.
- Identifies duplicate files based on file name and size.
- Provides options to delete duplicates or move them to a separate folder.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Install Rust and Cargo: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)


```sh
git clone https://github.com/balajimalathi/mem_cleaner.git
cd mem_cleaner
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in `target/release/`.

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line:

```sh
./mem_cleaner
```

Alternatively, specify a directory:

```sh
./mem_cleaner /path/to/directory
```

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to scan the current directory or enter a custom path.
2. It searches for files with the same name and size.
3. The user is given the option to delete duplicate files or move them to a `duplicates/` folder.

## Example Output

```json
G:\>mem_cleaner
Use current directory: "G:\\"? no
Enter directory path: G:\shadow
Scanning directory: "G:\\shadow"
Found 4 duplicate files.
Choose an action: Delete All
Are you sure you want to delete all duplicate files? yes
Deleted: "G:\\shadow\\Scanned_documents\\jnu.jpg"
Deleted: "G:\\shadow\\Scanned_documents\\ma.jpg"
Deleted: "G:\\shadow\\Untitled-1-min.jpg"
Deleted: "G:\\shadow\\Scanned_documents\\Scan print.jpg"

G:\>
```
